# Substrate ERC20

A Parity Substrate SRML module implementing the ERC20 interface. Only a single token is implemented and is initialized using the genesis config.

For a multi token runtime, check out [substrate-erc20-multi](https://github.com/parity-samples/substrate-erc20-multi)

### Important Note

The Substrate framework, related libraries and APIs are rapidly evolving. In case this module does not work with the latest Substrate build, please submit an issue in this repo.
You can also try porting the runtime module into a freshly cloned `substrate-node-template` codebase.

### Important Note 2

This code is just a sample for learning purposes. It is not audited and reviewed for production use cases. You can expect bugs and security vulnerabilities. Do **not** use it as-is in real applications.
